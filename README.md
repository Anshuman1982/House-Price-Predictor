#  House Price Predictor

A beginner-friendly machine learning web app that predicts the **median house value** in California based on basic housing features using a trained model and **Streamlit** for UI.

#  Dataset

- **Source:** California Housing Dataset (`housing.csv`)
- **Features used:**
  - Total Rooms
  - Total Bedrooms
  - Population
  - Households
  - Median Income
  - Ocean Proximity (categorical)

#  Model

- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Training Sample:** 5,000 random samples from the dataset
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Missing value handling
  - One-hot encoding for categorical column (`ocean_proximity`)
  - Feature scaling not required for tree-based models

#  Tools & Libraries

- Python 3.13
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- joblib
- streamlit
